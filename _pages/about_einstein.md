I am a Research Assistant at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in the Social AI Studio led by[Roy Ka-Wei Lee](https://info.roylee.sg/). I received my Bachelor of Engineering. with Honours and Distinction in Computer Science from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), focusing on artificial intelligence. While at SUTD, I worked part-time as an undegraduate researcher at the Social AI Studio.

Currently, my research interests revolve around the intersections of natural language processing, computational social science and machine learning engineering, sepcifically;:
1. How can we supplement LLMs reasoning over low-resouce languages and low-resource modalities in the context of hate classification? 
2. What kinds of factors affect cross-modal retrieval and cross-modal in-context learning?
3. How can we design a unified framework for analyzing the safety of various social media interactions and obtain fine-grained insights into the nature of violations, their severity, the targeted groups, and potential counternarratives?
