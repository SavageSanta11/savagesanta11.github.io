I am a Research Assistant at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in the Social AI Studio led by[Roy Ka-Wei Lee](https://info.roylee.sg/). I received my Bachelor of Engineering. with Honours and Distinction in Computer Science from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), focusing on artificial intelligence. While at SUTD, I worked part-time as an undegraduate researcher at the Social AI Studio.

I'm broadly interested in the following areas:
1. Low-resource hateful speech and memes tasks (classification, explanation, )
2. In-context learning
